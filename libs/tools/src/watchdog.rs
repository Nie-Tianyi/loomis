/// A watchdog thread that kills a process (by PID) if it exceeds a timeout.
///
/// The watchdog checks a shared [`AtomicBool`] every 100ms. When the process
/// finishes normally, the owner calls [`disarm()`](Watchdog::disarm) which
/// sets the flag and joins the thread. This guarantees `disarm()` returns
/// within 100ms regardless of the timeout duration.
///
/// # Platform behaviour
///
/// | OS | Kill command |
/// |----|-------------|
/// | Windows | `taskkill /F /T /PID <pid>` (tree kill) |
/// | Unix | `kill -9 <pid>` |
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// let child = Command::new("long-running-process").spawn()?;
/// let watchdog = Watchdog::spawn(child.id(), Duration::from_secs(30));
/// let output = child.wait_with_output()?;
/// watchdog.disarm(); // returns within 100ms
/// ```
