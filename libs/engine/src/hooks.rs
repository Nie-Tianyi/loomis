/// Lifecycle hook for observing and intervening in agent execution.
///
/// All methods have default no-op implementations — implement only
/// the events you care about. All methods are synchronous.
///
/// For async work (e.g. LLM summarisation / macro-compaction), use
/// [`tokio::runtime::Handle::block_on`] inside a sync hook method.
/// The agent loop runs in a dedicated tokio task separate from the
/// TUI thread, so blocking here does not affect the UI.
/// See [`MacroCompactHook`](hooks::MacroCompactHook) for an example.
///
/// ## Naming convention
///
/// | Prefix | Meaning |
/// |--------|---------|
/// | `on_<event>` | Pure notification — cannot intervene |
/// | `before_<action>` | Can intervene — return `Err` to block |
/// | `after_<action>` | Observe the result — cannot intervene |
///
/// ## Extension points
///
/// | Method | Called | Phase |
/// |--------|--------|-------|
/// | [`on_run_start`](Self::on_run_start) | When a new task begins | Run |
/// | [`on_run_finish`](Self::on_run_finish) | When the task terminates | Run |
/// | [`on_step_start`](Self::on_step_start) | Top of each ReAct loop iteration | Step |
/// | [`on_llm_start`](Self::on_llm_start) | Before building context for LLM | LLM |
/// | [`on_llm_end`](Self::on_llm_end) | After LLM response (success) | LLM |
/// | [`on_llm_error`](Self::on_llm_error) | When an LLM call fails | LLM |
/// | [`before_tool_call`](Self::before_tool_call) | Before tool execution | Tool |
/// | [`after_tool_call`](Self::after_tool_call) | After tool execution (success) | Tool |
/// | [`on_tool_failed`](Self::on_tool_failed) | When tool execution fails | Tool |
